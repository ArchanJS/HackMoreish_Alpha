## What problems we faced and how we overcame :
 * While building the game logic we were facing some logical error that we fixed by doing console.log in the required position to see output of various variables.
 
 * We were facing some scrolling issues while using I-Frames which we solved by manipulating overflow property of css and by using scrolling:no in Iframe component.
  
 * We were facing issues related to responsiveness of the website that was solved by using relative units and bootstrap media queries wherever required.

 * Initially the loading time of the website was large which was fixed by reducing heavy animations.

 * While working with ParticleJS, we faced some issues regarding responsiveness. We had to customize the number of particles according to the height and width of the screen to fix that.

###

## What we learnt building this website :

* Use of Iframes in React.

* Implementing audio functionality in React.

* Use of canvas API and its effective utilization.

* To work efficiently in teams within a stipulated time.
